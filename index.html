      <p id="description">Keely is my favorite person in history. Although his work is marred with claims of fraud and incomplete theories, I love those incomplete ideas that he left behind; so much is left to one's imagination. His research and thoughts about the vibratory nature of our reality is a fantastic concept to consider. Here are some interesting things about this man.
      <ul>
        <li>He was working on ideas that are echoed in modern quantum physics.</li>
        <li>He thought that the human brain was a kind of resonant device.</li>
        <li>He believed in the existence of the ether which he estimated has a density close to 1 million times that of steel.</li>
        <li>He failed to make a business to sell a motor based on his ideas about resonance which angered his investors and further lowered any credibility his ideas held during his time.</li>
        <li>Keely beleived that a gallon of water had the latent energy stored within it to destroy the entire universe if released all at once much like how an atomic bomb releases its energy, just much further down than the atomic level.</li>
        <li>His work is being revisited by <a href="http://www.svpwiki.com/Dale+Pond" target="_blank">Dale Pond</a> who has been expanding on Keely's work while applying his own ideas</li>
        <li>Although nothing ever came of his ideas, and in spite of any religious influences on his work, I think he is the most interesting inventor/con-man/whatever.</li>
      </ul>
